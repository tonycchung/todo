Make a simple html page to manage Todos.

It should have an input field. When the user enters text in the input field, add that input to the top of the Todo list. When an existing item is clicked, it should disappear from the page. 

In addition to pushing the answer to your Github account, please also setup a http://jsfiddle.net/ with the solution (so it runs correctly).
