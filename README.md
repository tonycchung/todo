#Simple TODO html page

##Coding challenge for Code Fellows
By [Tony Chung](https://github.com/tonycchung)

Make a simple html page to manage Todos.

It should have an input field. When the user enters text in the input field, add that input to the top of the Todo list. When an existing item is clicked, it should disappear from the page. 

You can play with the TODO page here:
